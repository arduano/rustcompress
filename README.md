# So I was bored

And I decided to port sharpcompress to rust

We'll see if I finish it, but so far I've done most of LZMA

There's so much mess in existing C and java and c# and whatever other reference code I'm finding

Things are so much cleaner in rust, with clear performance optimization opportunities too.

I'm planning to implement proper testing and fuzzing as well.
